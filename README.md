# queue-list

`queue-list` is a simple npm package that provides an implementation of a queue data structure in JavaScript. It allows you to easily create and manipulate queues with enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty, size, clear, and toArray operations. LinkedList is used to achieve this.

#### üëâNote: all the methods  including enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty, size, clear is having constant time complexityüòé O(1)

## Installation

To install the package, use npm:

```bash
npm install queue-list
```
# Usage

### Importing the package
```
import Queue from 'queue-list';
```

### Creating a Queue
```
// Creating an empty queue
const myQueue = new Queue();

// Creating a queue with initial values
const initializedQueue = new Queue(1, 2, 3);
console.log(initializedQueue);

//Expected output will be like 
Queue {
  start: Node { value: 1, next: Node { value: 2, next: Node { value: 3, next: null } } },
  last: Node { value: 3, next: null }
}
//Here start is referring to starting Node and last is referring to the last Node of the LinkedList.

console.log(initializedQueue.length);
//expected output is 3

```
 

## Enqueue
Add an element to the end of the queue.

```
myQueue.Enqueue(4);
```

## Dequeue
Remove and return the element from the front of the queue.

```
const dequeuedItem = myQueue.Dequeue();
```

## Peek
Get the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
```
const frontElement = myQueue.Peek();
```

## IsEmpty
Check if the queue is empty.
```
const emptyStatus = myQueue.IsEmpty();
```

## Size
Get the number of elements in the queue.
```
const queueSize = myQueue.Size();
```

## Clear
Remove all elements from the queue.
```
myQueue.Clear();
```

## ToArray
Convert the queue to an array.
```
const queueArray = myQueue.ToArray();
```

Example

```
const myQueue = new Queue(1, 2, 3);

myQueue.Enqueue(4);
myQueue.Enqueue(5);

console.log(myQueue.ToArray()); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const dequeuedItem = myQueue.Dequeue();
console.log(dequeuedItem); // 1

console.log(myQueue.Size()); // 4
console.log(myQueue.Peek()); // 2

myQueue.Clear();
console.log(myQueue.IsEmpty()); // true
```
Methods  | Use case | Time Complexity
------------- | ------------- | -------------
 Enqueue | Add an element to the end of the queue.  | O(1)
Dequeue  | Remove and return the element from the front of the queue.  | O(1)
Peek  | Get the element at the front of the queue without removing it.  | O(1)
IsEmpty  | Check if the queue is empty and return a boolean value  | O(1)
Size  | Get the number of elements in the queue.  | O(1)
Clear  | Remove all elements from the queue.  | O(1)
ToArray  | Convert the queue to an array.  | O(n)

### ‚û°Ô∏è the length of the queue can be accessed in two ways
1. <b>length property </b> 
2. <b>Size method</b>
